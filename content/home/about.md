# Biography

I am a graduate student working with [Prof. P B Sunil Kumar](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/sunil/) and [Prof. Ronojoy Adhikari](https://ronojoy.github.io/) in the Department of Physics at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. My research interests are in the area of non-equlibrium soft condensed matter and biological physics. I use computer simulations to study the complex structures and dynamics of these systems. 


 Before joining as a research scholar, I obtained my master degree (M.Sc) in Physics from Department of Physics, IIT Madras and Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Physics from Ramakrishna Mission Residential College Narendrapur, University of Calcutta.
