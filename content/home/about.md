# Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the group of [Prof. Dapeng (Max) Bi](https://sites.google.com/view/dapengbi) at the Department of Physics, Northeastern University. Prior to that I have worked as a postdoctoral associate in the group of [Prof. Lisa Manning](https://mmanning.expressions.syr.edu/) at Syracuse University and in the group of [Prof. Anna Balazs](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/AnnaBalazs/) at University of Pittsburgh. My research interests are in the area of non-equilibrium soft condensed matter and biological physics. I use computer simulations to study the complex structures and dynamics of these systems. 

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras under the guidance of 
 [Prof. P B Sunil Kumar](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/faculty-inner.php?fuid=78) and [Prof. Ronojoy Adhikari](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/ra413).
