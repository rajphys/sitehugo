title: Research
summary: "My research includes nonequilibrium dynamics of internally driven active polymers, chemomechanical transduction in chemically active elastic sheets, and dynamic self-organization of microparticles using active and driven fluids. Using computer simulations, we investigate different toplogical phenomena in active polymers for examples motile defects, the nonequilibrium transition between isotropic and liquid crystalline states, and the dynamic formation of knots and links . We also harnessed chemically generated fluid flow to perform self-sustained operations in elastic sheets, including self-morphing, self-rotating, and self-oscillating behavior. We also employ light- and chemically driven fluid pumping  for dynamic control over the motion of immersed microparticles, including the formation and transport of reversible particle assemblies, as well as the  separation of different sized particles in the fluidic chambers.
